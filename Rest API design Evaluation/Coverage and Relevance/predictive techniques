1- A general framework for correlating business process characteristics (2014) (G)
	*build-model/next-activity/ML/DT? activities=...&attributes=...&confidence-threshold=...
		    /last-value
                    /outcome
	This approach is used to create the decision tree for different prediction types => multiple output => multiple rest apis for same method

2- Prediction of business process durations using non-Markovian stochastic Petri nets (2015) [46] (G)
	*build_model/rem-time/ATS/SPN ? distribution-types =...&unit-time=...
		-- generate PN
		-- generate SPN
	*predict/rem_time/ATS/SPN ? monitoring-iterations=...&unit-time=...

3- Clustering-Based Predictive Process Monitoring (2016) [22] (G)
	*build-model/LTL/ML/CLUS?prefix-length-interval=...
		-- encoding
		-- clustering
		-- classification
	*predict/LTL/ML/CLUS?
	In this case there are two algorithms: clustering and decision tree but we were able to represent only one of them

4- Time and Activity Sequence Prediction of Business Process Instances (2018) [44] (G)
	*build-model/rem-time/ML/SVR
	*build-model/next-activity/STAT/NB
	*predict/rem-time/ML/SVR? deadline=...
	*predict/next-activity/STAT/NB
	two prediction types + two different algorithm for annotating system => different rest apis (the two building model api call for the same plugin)


5- PRISM â€“ A Predictive Risk Monitoring Approach for Business Processes [12]
	*predict/risk/similarity-measure/risk-propagation


6- Designing and Evaluating an Interpretable Predictive Modeling Technique for Business Processes [4]
	*build-model/next-activity/STAT/exceptation-maximization

7- Complex Symbolic Sequence Encodings for Predictive Monitoring of Business Processes [31]
	*build-model/outcome/machine-learning/hidden-markov-models and decision-tree
	*predict/outcome/machine-learning/hidden-markov-models and decision-tree

8- Predicting Deadline Transgressions Using Event Logs [41] (ProM)
	*predict/risk/STAT/risk-indicator

9- Comprehensible Predictive Models for Business Processes [5]
	*build-model/next-activity/STAT/exceptation-maximization 
	*predict/next-activity/STAT/exceptation-maximization
	
10- Predictive Business Process Monitoring with LSTM Neural Networks [55]
	*build-model/next-activity/ANN/LSTM
		    /remaining-time  same model is used for predicting both
	*predict/next-activity/ANN/LSTM
		/remaining-time  same model is used for predicting both

11- Run-time prediction of business process indicators using evolutionary decision rules [34] (G) building model (ProM) prediciton (Camunda BPMS)
	*build_model/indicator/STAT/evolutional-algortihm
		--computing indicator
		--encoding
		-- generate decision rule using evaluotional algorithm
	*predict/indicator/STAT/evolutional-algortihm
		--encoding
		--prediction
	This work is considered as classification and regression problem because EA support both types

12- Minimizing Overprocessing Waste in Business Processes via Predictive Activity Ordering [63] (G) available but not in ProM
	*build-model/outcome/machine-learning/SVM
		-- compute feature vector
		-- training the model
	*build-model/remaining-time/machine-leraning/SVM
		-- compute feature vector
		-- training the model
	*predict/outcome/machine-learning/SVM
		-- compute feature vector
		-- predict probability and time
	This approach takes the ongoing case, encode it and use the two trained models to predict the probabilities and the time
	which can not be represented in the prediction API
	Two building models for the same prediction method
